What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git subfolder is created with git metadata
We need this step to have git started to work on this folder and its subfolders, and handle all of them as a repository
How is the staging area different from the working directory and th repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area contains a subset of the working directory, all of the tracked files updated since the last commit.
Its value is that it can be changed before deciding what will go into the next commit

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I guess that using git diff --staged can surely shows which goes exactly to the next commit

When I want to try out some experimental code change, a branch would be a safe solution for doing that
