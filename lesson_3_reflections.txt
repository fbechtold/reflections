When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It is good when I want to share my work with other people and / or collaborating with others on common source code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I can do something different on my local repository while someone else pushes their changes onto the GitHub repository. In this case it is better to do the manual pull when appropriate rather than setting up that Git automatically pull changes which are not relevant to my current work.
