was introduced?

    It clearly showed the lines where there are differences so it was easier to spot the mistakes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pro: do it when it's meaningful
    con: easy to forget, needs careful handling of source code changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Depends on the purpose of the editors

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log --stat and git diff commitId1 commitId2 --stat

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It makes me more confident because by using version control I am able to revert back to the previous working version if something goes wrong

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Version control of my larger projects
